##Learning goals
	
On this subject I want to: 
*	get better at researching (my home University is mostly lecture-based)
*	learn how to implement a solution based on research
*	become more independent
*	get familiar with different libraries
*	learn how to visualize graphs
*	learn how to automatically test programs
*	try to further optimize the algorithm I have chosen

##What did I learn?

I spent lots of time on actually thinking what the problem could be. I wanted it to be something that is useful and can be practically used. I remembered some topics from Operations research, and then ChatGPT and a teaching assistant from that subject, from my home university helped me in converging to a few algorithms.

This week I did my first proper research, my friend helped me to get started. At my home University you just sit on the lectures and study from the textbook, and I was really out of my comfort zone, but felt great afterwards. In the end it turned out well. Some of the papers were too hard to follow as they were heavy on mathematics, and I realized that those were way too complex to implement anyways. Then I chose an algorithm that seemed more simple, computationally fine and there is also some room for improvement of the algorithm.

So, I got a bit more independent, I was out of my comfort zone and learned how Ant colony optimization works.
I consider this week to be a success.

##Time spent
*	lecture – 1.5 hours
*   thinking about possible problems and solutions, talking with teaching assistant back home (Used ChatGPT on this step to get ideas) – 4 hours
*	research and reading papers (Used ChatGPT to summarize some papers) – 4 hours
*	writing specification – 3 hours

Total: ~12.5 hours
