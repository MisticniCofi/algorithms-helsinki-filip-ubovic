#Week 3 report

Last week I started implementing the algorithm. I had to spend lots of time on understanding how it actually works and how it differs from other versions of ACO algorithm. Ant Colony Optimization by Marco Dorigo and Thomas St√ºtzle helped me a lot in figuring out the initial idea of the algorithm, parameters, data structures that I am supposed to use etc. But there is a big difference, since they were implementing unbalanced algorithms, meaning that one ant had to do all the work. In the paper that I am using to write the algorithm, some things are explained, but there a certain parameters missing.

I started writing in pseudocode. Lots of stuff was confusing for me, for example how is pheromone deposited. It was probably the thing that took me the longest time to figure out. I am still not sure if I have it figured out completely, there are many formulas that determine the values of parameters, so I still have to experiment on that. My pseudocode will be in a file named pseudocode.md. Please open it in a code editor.

Then I had to learn how to use NumPy library, which I am using because it is optimized for mathematical operations especially the ones involving arrays and matrices. Also, I had to learn how to organize a Python project and make your own libraries. I am very unexperienced in Python. 

I spent most of my time writing code, I want to finish this as soon as possible so I can move to other subjects, and I am almost done. I still have some bugs that need fixing. Then I will have to figure out the best suited formulas for parameters and how to test the program. I see a potential challenge because there is lots of random generation in the algorithms, I might need someone's help in testing it.

I will leave all the code in the folder aco_algorithm.

What I learned this week:

1. Numpy
2. I got more fluent in Python
3. Got extremely familiar with ACO algorithm
4. Learned how to make a Python project and libraries

Time spent:

~40 hours combined, I am not sure, but lots and lots of time.
